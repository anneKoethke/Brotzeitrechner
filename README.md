# Brotzeitrechner
A simple JS based visualization tool for nutrition concerning some Bavarian/German food for a Brotzeit. Calculates daily needs in salt, sugar, fat, carbonhydrates, protein and calories.

### using:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SVG
I did indeed draw those SVGs myself - with GIMP, because I hate myself ;) 

responsive design, i.e. it works on all common browsers (IE_11 get's a PNG..)

### what it should look like
